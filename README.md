WHAT THIS PROJECT DO?

We started with selecting interesting data. We choose data of Food.com from kaggle. To understand the data first we did the data analysis, where we saw different data files and there length, central tendency metric for various columns/features, the relation between the features and the outlier analysis. Once we analyzed the data and saw the issues, we worked upon to resolve them by handling outliers.

Then we started with classification where we introduced the new column as Cusine for our data set. Using the new column we analysed our data and came up with interesting analysis. Second, we performed clustering over the ingredients, for that we performed PCA, vectorization and K-means. Analysing cluster over rating and review provides us with meaningful insights. After that, we saw regression where by help of Carbs and Calories we predected other nutritional values using Gradient Boosting Regression. Last but not the least we performed Market Basket Analysis which can be profitable for the sales.
